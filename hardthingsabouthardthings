Far too often, CEOs hire executives based on an abstract notion of what they think and feel the executive should be like. This error often leads to the executive not bringing the key, necessary qualities to the table.\\n\\n* *You hired for lack of weakness rather than for strengths.* This is especially common when you run a consensus-based hiring process. The group will often find the candidate’s weaknesses, but they won’t place a high enough value on the areas where you need the executive to be a world-class performer. As a result, you hire an executive with no sharp weaknesses, but who is mediocre where you need her to be great. If you don’t have world-class strengths where you need them, you won’t be a world-class company.\\n\\n* *You hired for scale too soon.* The most consistently wrong advice that venture capitalists and executive recruiters give CEOs is to hire someone “bigger” than required. “Think about the next three to five years and how you will be a large company” is how the bad advice usually sounds. It’s great to hire people who can run a large-scale organization if you have one. It’s also great to hire people who know how to grow an organization very fast if you are ready to grow your organization very fast. However, if you do not or you are not, then you need someone who can do the job for the next eighteen months. If you hire someone who will be great *in* eighteen months but will be poor for the next eighteen months, the company will reject her before she ever gets a chance to show her stuff. Your other employees will wonder: Why did we give her all those stock options when she’s not contributing anything? Those kinds of questions are impossible to recover from. It turns out that venture capitalists and executive recruiters are not stupid; they just learned the wrong lessons from previous failures. To learn the right lesson, see the *special case of scaling* and *the special case of fast growth* as explained below.\\n\\n* *You hired for the generic position.* There is no such thing as a great CEO, a great head of marketing, or a great head of sales. There is only a great head of sales for your company for the next twelve to twenty-four months. That position is not the same as the same position at Microsoft or Facebook. Don’t look for the candidate out of central casting. This is not a movie.\\n\\n* *The executive had the wrong kind of ambition.* In chapter 6, I will describe the difference between ambition for the company and ambition for oneself. If an executive has the wrong kind of ambition, then despite her skills, the company may reject her.\\n\\n* *You failed to integrate the executive.* Bringing a new person into your company in an important role is difficult.

To set high benchmarks, interview top performers in your field to understand excellence standards, and hold your executives to these goals, expecting remarkable outcomes without micromanaging. Ensure they are goal-driven and well-integrated within the team. Use Bill Campbell's framework to evaluate executives on four areas: Results against objectives, Management, Innovation, and Working with peers, ensuring they meet these ambitious goals.

Approach this carefully since senior hires can greatly impact your company, both positively and negatively. Avoid vague reasons such as “adult supervision” and instead seek specific expertise, especially in areas like global sales and branding where you might lack proficiency. Evaluate the need for internal promotions versus external hires—internal understanding often trumps external knowledge in technical roles, but for selling to large enterprises, prioritize those who understand your target customers. Integrating senior hires into a small company is tough; they might struggle to adapt from larger organizations. Ensure they strictly adhere to your company culture, introduce new ideas clearly, and avoid political gamesmanship. Set high performance standards to aim for excellence rather than competency. For instance, in PR, seek experts who can transform perceptions through established relationships. Interview top performers to grasp excellence, then hold executives to these standards.

Faced with daunting decisions, like taking Loudcloud public to avoid bankruptcy with minimal revenue or declining lucrative acquisition offers, I've learned that courage and correct decisions build essential leadership qualities. Jim Collins' *Good to Great* notes internal candidates outperform due to deeper company knowledge but doesn't cover why some fail, which I attribute to imbalances in strategic and operational skills. Effective leadership involves vision, ambition for alignment, and competence, with varied styles like Jobs, Campbell, and Grove proving successful. Legendary advisor Bill Campbell highlighted the rare combination of peacetime and wartime leadership, necessary for navigating periods of stability and crisis. CEOs need to embrace unnatural actions, like giving uncomfortable feedback and developing a unique skill set over years. Clear, kind communication and direct feedback are vital for maintaining high standards and addressing issues. Evaluating a CEO's performance should focus on their knowledge, execution ability, and results, considering the company's context, as illustrated by leaders like Reed Hastings of Netflix.\",\"type\":\"section\"}],\"summary\":\"Our company faced a critical juncture after selling Loudcloud to EDS, which confused investors and tanked our stock to $0.35 per share, risking NASDAQ delisting. Rather than resorting to reverse splits or penny stock status, I, with guidance from Ron Conway, sought investor support, ultimately convincing Herb Allen of Allen & Company to invest, lifting our stock to $3 per share and restoring hope. This pivotal moment underscored focusing on essential success factors rather than past or potential mistakes. As a CEO, my toughest challenge was developing my own psychology amidst stress and solitary decision-making. Psychological support, detailed decision-making, and goal-oriented focus helped me cope, emphasizing resilience, courage, and unwavering tenacity, as stressed by Alfred Chuang. Effective leadership requires clear decision-making roles and a balance between vision, ambition, and competence, with examples from leaders like Steve Jobs, Bill Campbell, and Andy Grove.

It was very clever, and totally dirty. To fight back, savvy customers started requiring all software vendors to include “the CA clause” in their contracts.

Historically, all the returns in venture capital had been concentrated in a tiny number of firms and consistently by a small number of the same firms. Of the more than eight hundred venture capital firms of the day, only about six had delivered great returns for their investors. As we dug deeper, we uncovered an excellent reason for this: The best entrepreneurs will only work with the best venture capital firms. Since venture capital firms were notoriously secretive about their methods and beliefs—most firms did almost no PR and stated very little about what they did—the firms competed on their investing track records. Therefore, the firms with the best track records continued to have the best track records, thus making it nearly impossible for a new firm, with no track record, to crack into the top tier.\",\"index\":1477,\"type\":\"markdown\",\"summarizable\":true},{\"content\":\"We needed some way to break through to become the firm that great entrepreneurs wanted to work with.

We just did what we did, without really seeing ourselves as part of a larger “movement” or a community. We were entrepreneurs at the beginning of the Internet and before Facebook, Twitter, and the other social networking platforms were built. We did not talk to other entrepreneurs, because there was no entrepreneurial community. We were completely heads down on the business. All that has changed in the last ten years. Entrepreneurs are now socializing, friending each other, meeting up, and hanging out. There is a real community. Once we realized this, we figured that if we had a better offering, word-of-mouth marketing would work now where it hadn’t before.\",\"index\":1479,\"type\":\"markdown\",\"summarizable\":true},{\"content\":\"We needed to be better, but we also needed to be different. As we thought about what would make us both better and different, two core ideas greatly influenced our thinking: First, technical founders are the best people to run technology companies. All of the long-lasting technology companies that we admired—Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook—had been run by their founders. More specifically, the innovator was running the company. Second, it was incredibly difficult for technical founders to learn to become CEOs while building their companies. I was a testament to that.

For this we drew both the inspiration and the formula from my friend and Opsware board member Michael Ovitz. Thirty-four years earlier, Michael had founded Creative Artists Agency (CAA), the powerhouse of Hollywood talent agencies. When Michael started CAA, it was not an obvious idea. The talent agency business had existed since vaudeville and had changed very little in the ensuing seventy-five years. Michael was a rising star at the William Morris Agency, the most important agency in the industry at the time. Quitting that job to pursue what must have looked like a windmill tilt made no sense to anybody.

This traditional model sounded a lot like the traditional venture capital business, where VCs worked in the same firm but managed their own networks and their own portfolios.\",\"index\":1488,\"type\":\"markdown\",\"summarizable\":true},{\"content\":\"Ovitz’s breakthrough idea was to build an integrated network that would allow any of the firm’s agents to connect their clients to a firm-wide grid of new opportunities. As a result, the firm would be a hundred times more powerful than any one agent at any other agency. To implement the idea, Ovitz and his founding partners agreed to defer their salaries for several years and invest their commissions into building what Ovitz referred to as “The Franchise.” The Franchise consisted of specialists running networks and portfolios in each relevant area: book publishing, international, music, and more. His theory worked, and within fifteen years, CAA represented 90 percent of the top talent in Hollywood and had rewritten the rules—giving talent more say in deals and a bigger piece of the financial pie.\",\"index\":1489,\"type\":\"markdown\",\"summarizable\":true},{\"hierarchy\":[{\"content\":\"We decided to copy CAA’s operating model nearly exactly—in fact, Andreessen Horowitz employees have the same titles as the original CAA employees: partner.

This seemed tricky, because no major venture capital firm did any marketing of any kind. We figured there must be a good explanation for this, but struggled to find one. Finally, Marc discovered that the original venture capital firms in the late 1940s and early ’50s were modeled after the original investment banks such as J.P. Morgan and Rothschild. Those banks also did not do PR for a very specific reason: The banks funded wars—and sometimes both sides of the same war—so publicity was not a good idea. This insight, combined with our general instinct to counterprogram whatever the big guys were doing, led us to launch Andreessen Horowitz with great fanfare. When deciding on the name, the biggest problem we faced was that, as a firm, we were nobodies. No track record, no portfolio companies, no nothing. But people knew us and they especially knew Marc. So I said, “Rather than trying to create a totally new brand from scratch, why not just use your brand?” Marc thought that made sense, but nobody would ever be able to spell “Andreessen Horowitz” when typing in the URL. Thinking back to old-time computer programming in the days before programming languages supported internationalization, we used to have to “internationalize” our code. We called this internationalization process “I18N” for short (localization was L10N), which meant *I* followed by eighteen letters followed by *N*.
