When I was trying to sell Loudcloud's cloud services, Bill Campbell starkly advised me to prepare for bankruptcy despite my efforts with IBM and EDS. His tone implied that bankruptcy wasn't just a contingency but the likely outcome, much like a doctor with a doomed patient. This harsh reality prepared me for potential failure during a tech downturn. However, I never built that contingency plan. Through the arduous Loudcloud series C and IPO processes, I learned that startup CEOs shouldn't play the odds but must believe in finding answers regardless.

Far too often, CEOs hire executives based on an abstract notion of what they think and feel the executive should be like. This error often leads to the executive not bringing the key, necessary qualities to the table.\\n\\n* *You hired for lack of weakness rather than for strengths.* This is especially common when you run a consensus-based hiring process. The group will often find the candidate’s weaknesses, but they won’t place a high enough value on the areas where you need the executive to be a world-class performer. As a result, you hire an executive with no sharp weaknesses, but who is mediocre where you need her to be great. If you don’t have world-class strengths where you need them, you won’t be a world-class company.\\n\\n* *You hired for scale too soon.* The most consistently wrong advice that venture capitalists and executive recruiters give CEOs is to hire someone “bigger” than required. “Think about the next three to five years and how you will be a large company” is how the bad advice usually sounds. It’s great to hire people who can run a large-scale organization if you have one. It’s also great to hire people who know how to grow an organization very fast if you are ready to grow your organization very fast.

It turns out that venture capitalists and executive recruiters are not stupid; they just learned the wrong lessons from previous failures. To learn the right lesson, see the *special case of scaling* and *the special case of fast growth* as explained below.\\n\\n* *You hired for the generic position.* There is no such thing as a great CEO, a great head of marketing, or a great head of sales. There is only a great head of sales for your company for the next twelve to twenty-four months. That position is not the same as the same position at Microsoft or Facebook. Don’t look for the candidate out of central casting.

As part of this, they prefer the founding CEO to have a very low salary. In general, this is a good idea, because the temptation to walk away when things go poorly is intense and total financial commitment helps him to keep his other commitments. However, once the company starts to become a company rather than an idea it makes sense to pay the CEO at market. More specifically, once the company has a business (as defined above) and becomes an attractive acquisition target, it makes sense to pay the CEO, so that the decision to keep or sell the company isn’t a direct response to the CEO’s personal financial situation, as in “I don’t think that we should sell the company, but I live in an eight-hundred-fifty-square-foot apartment with my husband and two kids and it’s that or divorce.”\\n\\n* *Be clear with the company.* One question that every startup CEO gets from her employees is “Are you selling the company?” This is an incredibly difficult question. If she says nothing, the employee will likely interpret this to mean the company is for sale. If she says “at the right price,” the employee will wonder what that price is and may even ask. If the company ever reaches that price, the employee will assume the company will be sold. If she dodges the question with the standard “the company is not for sale,” the employee may feel betrayed if the company is ever sold. More important, the CEO may feel like she is betraying the employee and that feeling will influence her decision-making process. One way to avoid these traps is to describe the analysis in the prior section: If the company achieves product-market fit in a very large market and has an excellent chance to be number one, then the company will likely remain independent.

This seemed tricky, because no major venture capital firm did any marketing of any kind. We figured there must be a good explanation for this, but struggled to find one. Finally, Marc discovered that the original venture capital firms in the late 1940s and early ’50s were modeled after the original investment banks such as J.P. Morgan and Rothschild. Those banks also did not do PR for a very specific reason: The banks funded wars—and sometimes both sides of the same war—so publicity was not a good idea. This insight, combined with our general instinct to counterprogram whatever the big guys were doing, led us to launch Andreessen Horowitz with great fanfare. When deciding on the name, the biggest problem we faced was that, as a firm, we were nobodies. No track record, no portfolio companies, no nothing. But people knew us and they especially knew Marc. So I said, “Rather than trying to create a totally new brand from scratch, why not just use your brand?” Marc thought that made sense, but nobody would ever be able to spell “Andreessen Horowitz” when typing in the URL. Thinking back to old-time computer programming in the days before programming languages supported internationalization, we used to have to “internationalize” our code. We called this internationalization process “I18N” for short (localization was L10N), which meant *I* followed by eighteen letters followed by *N*. We decided that the firm’s nickname would be “a16z,” as in *a* followed by sixteen letters followed by *z*.\",\"index\":1492,\"type\":\"markdown\",\"summarizable\":true},{\"content\":\"We hired the Outcast marketing agency, headed up by its formidable founder, Margit Wennmachers, to generate media interest. We needed people to know what we were about as we had decided to defy the conventional venture capital theory of no PR. The daughter of a German pig farmer, Margit was the furthest thing from a swine wrangler imaginable. Smart and sophisticated, she was the Babe Ruth of PR.

If he could do those things, he’d almost never sleep. But at Opsware, he’d only gotten to do two of the three. Not getting to work on transactions was torture for Scott. He was like a caged animal. And I’d kept him in that cage for eight long years.

Balancing football, academics, and social circles honed my skills for entrepreneurship. In 1986, a blind date with Felicia Wiley led to a nearly 25-year marriage with three children. A college gig at Silicon Graphics spurred my interest in modern computer graphics, leading to a career at SGI, then NetLabs, and ultimately Netscape where I managed the Enterprise Web Server product line. After a turbulent IPO during the dot-com crash, we sold Netscape to AOL and founded Loudcloud, aiming to manage computing cloud security and scaling. Facing a dire financial climate in 2000, we launched a complex IPO and eventually sold Loudcloud to EDS, leading to the creation and success of Opsware. Despite challenges, including EDS technical issues and fierce competition from BladeLogic, we rebounded with key acquisitions and strategic pivots, growing our stock value significantly. We navigated executive compensation, talent retention, and performance management, echoing lessons from industry pioneers like Bill Campbell and Andy Grove. By maintaining a strong sense of purpose, hiring for alignment with company goals, and fostering a distinct culture, I transitioned from Opsware’s sale to HP to co-founding Andreessen Horowitz.
